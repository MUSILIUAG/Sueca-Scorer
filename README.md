# Sueca-Scorer

 This intends to contribute to a robot referee which observes
sueca games as they are played by people, and even robot players, checks that the games
conform to the rules and then says who won and the final score when the game finishes,
This is done to automate scoring and tackling cheating in sueca
 
Sueca games can become competitive at times and pairs often cheat by resorting to
illegal cuts. It aims to build a python implementation, called sueca scorer, which takes sueca
games described in text files and says which pair won along with the points awarded by
each pair, and identifies situations of invalidity with the given sueca games.
The scorer may be called from the command line.
